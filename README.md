# KEY CONCEPTS:

## Usage: 
L-systems can be used to model plant growth, generate procedural landscapes, and create various fractal art forms. 

## Axiom: 
The starting string that initiates the process. 

## Production Rules: 
A set of rules that specify how symbols in the string are replaced. Each rule typically has a symbol on the left-hand side and a string on the right-hand side. 

## Iteration: 
The process of repeatedly applying the production rules to the string, generating new strings in each iteration. 

## Turtle Graphics: 
A common method to visualize L-systems by interpreting symbols in the string as commands to draw lines, turn, or save the current state. 

## Fractal Nature: 
The iterative nature of L-systems allows them to create self-similar, fractal-like structures.
